# mdprev

Preview your markdown files in the browser with the github flavoured CSS and syntax.

```
mdprev markdown_file.md
```

This will open your default browser and show the markdown file.

`mdprev` also listens for changes and updates HTML.

### TODOs:

- Open mdprev with random port.
- Open mdprev in the background and listen for websocket connection close to terminate itself.
